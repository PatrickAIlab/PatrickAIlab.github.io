  description: Prior neural radiance fields (NeRF) typically use a single RGB-only sensor as the only source of input, and are therefore strict with images and camera poses. In this paper, we propose ToF-NeRF, a model that fuses an additional ToF-depth sensor to the RGB-only sensor, enhancing the reconstruction ability of the neural radiance field to enable faster training, fewer input views, and higher quality (SNR).
