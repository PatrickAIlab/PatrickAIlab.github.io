# The AI Design Lab at Shanghai

Welcome to the AI Design Lab at [Fudan Unversity](https://sme.fudan.edu.cn/), a dynamic research facility at the forefront of the intersection between AI and design. Situated within the prestigious Fudan University in Shanghai, China, our lab is dedicated to exploring and applying AI technologies in various design domains. With a focus on depth information, 2D and 3D computer vision, 3D reconstruction, object detection, and reinforcement learning, our lab aims to push the boundaries of AI-driven design applications.

Computational data-driven research focuses on developing and applying computational methods across various types of omics datasets. Such research is performed in a new type of laboratory, often called a dry lab. Our team designs, develops and applies novel and robust data-driven, computational approaches that will accelerate the diffusion of genomics and biomedical data into translational research and education.
