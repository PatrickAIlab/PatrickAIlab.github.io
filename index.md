The laboratory is dedicated to the application of AI to computer, including: 2D - 3D computer vision, Transformer algorithms, Depth - RGB fusion, Depth Sensor enhancements / fusion, and hardware accelerators. Our goal is to develop AI technologies to help us better collect, understand and interpret visual data, and apply them to  real-world scenarios. (i.e. AR / VR, Autonomous Driving, Medical Imaging).

We are developing a design pedagogy about applying and using AI, for real-world end-use applications.  This includes: customer need-finding, 
usage scenarios, and data collection/labeling/training/inference.  Students are then involved in industrial projects to solve real-world
problems that leverage the latest open-source AI models.
