# <i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Depth Completion

Depth completion aims to predict dense depth maps with sparse depth measurements from a depth sensor. Currently, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models are the most popular methods applied to depth completion tasks. The Transformer, which is an adaptive self-attention setting sequence-to-sequence model.
